# Simulation Studies

Here is the code for my two undergraudate research projects completed at McGill University. The first is a study of various error control methods in the context of multiple hypotheses testing, and the second is a study of error control methods in the context of meta-analysis, with clear applications to clinical research studies. Both simulation studies utilize the simsalapar package in R. Preliminary graphical representation of the analysis is included at the end (using ggplot).
